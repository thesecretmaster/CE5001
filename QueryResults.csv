The question is: where does Prolog actually apply an *interpretation* of it as an operator. That happens in the body of a predicate, or at the command line. So you can say, `?- eats(Person, baked) ; eats(Person, fried).` and this will show you all `Person` values where that person eats baked or that person eats fried. But if you write `eats(baked ; fried)`, Prolog does *not* interpret `;`. It's just a functor, and it sees this as `eats(';'(baked, fried))`. This may seem odd, but it allows you to write predicates to reason about `;`.","","2","2018-02-12 08:06:47","2018-02-12 21:03:11","42026","1121"

If it was a piece of code that I write for myself, I'd probably use `zipWithIndex` without thinking about it. But yeah...

PHP accepts several [delimiters](http://php.net/manual/en/regexp.reference.delimiters.php) in PCRE. The `regex` can be written as `'/[:;,.<> \/)(]+/'` (uses `/` as delimiter) but in this case the internal `/` must be [escaped](http://php.net/manual/en/regexp.reference.escape.php) and this makes it less clear.","","2","2018-02-04 20:52:54","2018-02-04 21:29:05","40280","40280"

Besides making sure that the function works with a variety of inputs, it documents what the expected behavior is. I haven't done TDD, but in this case I can see the value of writing the tests first, including tests for all of these edge cases, and in the tests specifying what the result should be. That forces you to decide up front what behavior you want for all of those edge cases.

There is no need for cursor FOR loop. The pure SQL SELECT statement is an aggregate query on top of a join and it returns just a number. The PL/SQL block should declare a single variable - the desired number - and select that total amount INTO the variable, and then display the variable. No need for any loops here; if any looping is necessary, Oracle will do it in the SQL context.","Oracle PL/SQL Anonymous Block to retrieve Data from Two Tables (NOVA Environment)","1","2018-02-07 13:51:49","2018-02-07 13:58:34","23288","79"

One thing to keep in mind though, as you are starting to learn PL/SQL. Doing things in plain SQL is still the best option in most cases, if it is an option at all. (That is, only do in PL/SQL those things that you simply can't do in plain SQL.) I personally find it dangerous to practice using loops - reading and processing one row at a time from a base table - in a PL/SQL block, instead of doing set-level processing in SQL. If you must practice loops (for example), look for tasks that CAN'T be done in SQL, at least not easily. Don't practice doing in PL/SQL tasks that are easy in SQL.","Oracle PL/SQL Anonymous Block to retrieve Data from Two Tables (NOVA Environment)","1","2018-02-07 13:51:49","2018-02-07 15:03:21","23288","79"

I believe it is because my server is sending cookies with expiration dates in the format of: 14-Feb-18 03:13:52 GMT
instead of the 4 character year.  Wiki says (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Expires_and_Max-Age)
it is in 2 or 4 character years.  Not exactly sure why it causes concurrent mod exception.  The solution for
me:
        request.setCookiesEnabled(false);

That is not what I have asked for (it's not a duplicate for: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/255202/how-do-i-view-git-diff-output-with-my-preferred-diff-tool-viewer).

Im aware that you can choose another diff tool when comparing in git,
the question is where can I find such tool.

I would like to see side by side the diffrences between the message flows / mapping nodes that has changed (IIB development) as it should be displayed, and not in a textual way.

(A) 
Using the nested loop means the code is only looking for nested arrays which is why if I use a single loop on this array everything is logged from the outer array level as expected [1,2] [3,4] [5,6] 7 8.
(B) 
It works with the strings because they are ""iterable"" and the length property can be applied to them (i.e they can be indexed).","Nested for loops and multidimensional arrays","1","2018-02-24 00:47:26","2018-02-24 03:17:54","26","26"

But unfortunately it's not quite what I need, If the original value of pp is 100 and I run the code once, it will correctly calculate 400. If the user clicks on a filter that will change the price to 50£ I see for a second 200£ and then it will automatically re-run the whole function and change the amount back to (400x4). That's because when the function runs again the 400 which is the new value of the span will be re-assigned to pp.","","2","2018-02-25 23:37:17","2018-02-26 08:15:20","1","370"
